# Lecture Notes
Greetings Chem131C at UCI, here are my version of the Lecture Notes for the course. 
The notes are split up by week (10 weeks total) with 3 lectures a week (MWF, 1hour). 
The notes contain a pdf (and the associated LaTex file and figures for compiling the pdf) for each lecture.

## Brief Summary:
