Solution to a problem similar to McQuarrie 18-9

Question:
Plot the vibrational Contribution to the molar Heat Capacity from (250-1000)K for a gas.

Answer:
Using equation 18.26 (P.741) we find C_vib(T) for diatomic molecules. 

Code:

prob1.f90 : Fortran code to calculate and write T, C(T) to a file

data.dat : Data file with 2 columns T, C(T)

plot.py : Python code to plot our data, reads in data.dat and outputs myfig.png

myfig.png : The final answer!!!

a.out : This is machine code written by the fortran compiler, !===IGNORE THIS===!

.DS_Store : This is a github maitenance file, !===IGNORE THIS===!
