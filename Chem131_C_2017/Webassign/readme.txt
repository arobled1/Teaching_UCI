Here you will find supplemental information for the electronic homework (webassign). 

The homework is mostly from McQuarrie and Simon, and there is a solution manual availble for purchase. 

I will do my best to provide practical and simple programs for analyzing and plotting the solutions to the problems when appropriate. 

Please feel free to use this source code yourself as templates for your own learning.
