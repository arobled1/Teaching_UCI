You have found my notes for Thermodynamics, Chem131C at UCI (Spring 2017). 

## Instructors:
The instructor for the course is `Dr. Craig Martens` (cmartens@uci.edu)

Teaching Assistants :
`Krista Parry` (parryk@uci.edu), and `Shane Flynn` (swflynn@uci.edu).

### Logistics:

#### Lecture:
MWF 11:00-11:50 (am) in Humanities Hall 178

#### Textbook:
The suggested text for the class is Physical Chemistry, a Molecular Approach, by McQuarrie and Simon. 
The course will 'loosely' follow the textbook, the Lecture Notes are your primary concern, the textbook is supplemental.

The grading is subject to change, however, expect something like 15% homework, 30% Midterm, 55% Final Exam.
