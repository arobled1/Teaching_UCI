# Welcome:
You have found my notes for Thermodynamics, Chem131C at UCI (Spring 2017). 

## Instructors:
The instructor for the course is `Dr. Craig Martens` (cmartens@uci.edu)

Teaching Assistants :
`Krista Parry` (parryk@uci.edu), and `Shane Flynn` (swflynn@uci.edu).

## Logistics:

#### Lecture:
MWF 11:00-11:50 (am) in Humanities Hall 178

#### Textbook:
The suggested text for the class is Physical Chemistry, a Molecular Approach, by McQuarrie and Simon. 
The course will 'loosely' follow the textbook, the Lecture Notes are your primary concern, the textbook is supplemental. 

#### Grading:
The grading is subject to change, however, expect something like 15% homework, 30% Midterm, 55% Final Exam. 

## Lecture_notes:
Directory containing all of my typred Lecture Notes for the course. 
Each lecture is written in a LaTex file (name.tex) and converted to a pdf. 
If you are familiar with LaTex, feel free to download the Tex file and edit as you like (I have included all of the figures and etc. for compiling the Tex file). 

## Sample_Problems:
This directory contains a few sample programs as an introduction to programming. 
Inside you will find Python scripts for answering a few problems from the course (also a few Fortran for those brave enough to try).
Feel free to use these programs to start learning to code!
