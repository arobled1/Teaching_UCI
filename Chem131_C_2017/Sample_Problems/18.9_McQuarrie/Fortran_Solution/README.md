# Fortran Soltuion:
Here is a simple Fortran 90 Program to plot T vs C(T) 

### 18_9_soln.f90:
The fortran program.
This file uses the Fortran Programming Language to calculate T and C(T). 
The output of this program is a data file; data.dat 

### data.dat:
Data file containing 2 columns: T and C(T)

### plot.py:
Fortran cannot plot data by itself, this is a Python Program to open data.dat and plot it

### myfig.png:
This is the final result, a graph of T vs C(T)
