# Python Solution:
A simple Python 2 Program to calculate and plot both T and C(T)

### 18_9_soln.py:
The Python Program.
This file uses the Python Programming Language to calculate T and C(T). 
It then plots these two variables and saves the figure as: myfig.png

### myfig.png:
This is the final result, a graph of T vs C(T)
