# Exam Statistics
You can take courses explaining all of the different useful statistical descriptions for a data set. 
Here I provide a quick Python Program to calculate some common statistical indicators.
This code is intended for analyzing the midterm scores for a class. 

## Python Code
The code expects you to provide a data file containing 2 columns (student I.D. Exam Scare). 
The code actually only needs the exam scores to do statistics, we read in the data line by line and split it by column. 
We then calculate the number of exams, the high and low score, the standard average, the median, and the standard deviation. 
Finally we plot a histogram of the scorse with bins of size 10 spanning 0 to 100.
