# Sample Problems:
Greetings Chem131C at UCI, and welcome to the Sample Problems
This directory will contain sample problems discussed during the course. 

## Code:
The purpose for these sample problems is as an introduction to programming. 
Physical Chemistry is a great area for learning how to program, and any undergraduate degree in the sciences should do some basic data analysis (Excel is not sufficient for the 'Real World'). 

All of the code will be done using the Python Language. 
You are not required to read/learn any of this material for the course.... but I suggest you take a look.
Learning to program may seem challenging, but these aexamples will walk you through a program step-by-step (with comments at every line). 
Feel free to come ask me about running the programs, I am happy to explain the basics of coding and how to get started. 

Enjoy!
