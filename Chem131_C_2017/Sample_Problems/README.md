# Sample Problems:
Greetings Chem131C at UCI, and welcome to the Sample Problems.
This directory will contain some problems discussed during the course, with Python code!

## Code:
The purpose for these sample problems is as an introduction to programming. 
Physical Chemistry is a great area for learning how to program, and any undergraduate degree in the sciences should have some basic data analysis (Excel is not sufficient for the 'Real World'). 
If you do any type of work that generates data (theory or experimental) Python is a great resource for analyzing the data efficiently and without systematic error that cannot be found (your source code does exactly what you tell it to). 

### Python:
All of the code will be done using the Python Language. 
You are not required to read/learn any of this material for the course.... but I suggest you take a look.
Learning to program may seem challenging, but these examples will walk you through a program step-by-step (with comments at every line). 
Feel free to come ask me about running the programs, I am happy to explain the basics of coding and how to get started. 

Enjoy!
