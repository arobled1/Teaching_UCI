# Sample Problems:
Greetings Chem131C at UCI, and welcome to the Sample Problems.
This directory will contain some problems discussed during the course, with Python code!

## Why Code:
When you took Organic Chemistry you learned how to use distillation glassware, Biochemistry taught you how to use an autoclave and a centrifuge, and Physical Chemists and well known for actually building their own equipment for making very percise measurements.

The lecture section of physical chemistry most closely resembles the work done by Theoretical Chemists. 
The main tools for a theorist are a pen and paper for writing equations, and a computer for applying their equations to study chemical systems. 

More generally programming is a skill that can help you both save time and increase accuracy. 
A computer program does exactly what you tell it, the results will always be reproducible. 
Anyone who has to do data analysis (which I imagine includes all scientists) will benefit from learning basic programming. 

## Sample Problems
The purpose for these sample problems is as an introduction to programming. 
Physical Chemistry is a great area for learning how to program, and any undergraduate degree in the sciences should have some basic data analysis (Excel is not sufficient for the 'Real World'). 


### Python:
All of the code will be done using the Python Language. 
Learning to program may seem challenging, but these examples will walk you through a program step-by-step (with comments at every line). 
Feel free to come ask me about running the programs, I am happy to explain the basics of coding and how to get started. 
If you are interested in learning more about programming, feel free to look at my Python Lessons and examples (https://github.com/swflynn/python_tutorials)

Enjoy!
