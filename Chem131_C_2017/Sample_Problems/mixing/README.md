# Mixing Problem:
Quick Python calculation for the additional problem 1 from the mixing assignment.

## Question:
A tank filled with O2 gas at a temperature of T = 298(K) and pressure of p = 10 (atm) is attached to a vessel of volume V = 1(m3) full of N2 gas at T = 298(K) and p = 1(atm) pressure.
The valve is opened and the gases are allowed to mix. 
Assuming they are both ideal diatomic gases (C_v = 5/2 R) , calculate the change in Gibbs free energy and entropy of the process.

## Solution:
The system is closed, therefore we can determine the total number of moles as the sum of Oxygen and Nitrogen.
