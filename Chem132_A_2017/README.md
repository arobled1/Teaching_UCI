# Welcome:
You have found my notes for Thermodynamics, Chem132A at UCI (Fall 2017). 

Topics included are: Perfect and Real gases, Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution, the Laws of Thermodynamics,

## Instructors:
The instructor for the course is `Dr. John Hemminger` (jchemmin@uci.edu)

Teaching Assistants: 
`Moises Romero` (moiseser@uci.edu) and `Shane Flynn` (swflynn@uci.edu)

## Logistics:

#### Lecture:
MWF 11-11:50(am); PCB 1100

#### Discussions:
`Tuesday:` 11-11:50(am); ICF 101. (Shane). 1-1:50(pm); RH188 (Shane).

`Wednesday:` 12-12:50(pm); PSCB 230. (Moises). 1-1:50(pm); RH 188 (Moises). 2-2:50(pm); RH 188 (Moises).

`Thursday:` 12-12:50(pm); PSCB 240. (Shane). 

`Friday:` 10-10:50(am); SSPA 1170. (Shane). 1-1:50(pm); SSL 145 (Moises)

#### Textbook:
The suggested text for the class is `Physical Chemistry Thermodynamics, Structure, and Change (10 Edition)` by Peter Atkins and Julio de Paula. 

#### Grading:
The grading is subject to change, however, expect something like: 


## Lecture_notes:
Directory containing all of my typed Lecture Notes for the course. 
Each lecture is written in a LaTex file (name.tex) and converted to a pdf. 
If you are familiar with LaTex, feel free to download the Tex file and edit as you like (I have included all of the figures and etc. for compiling the Tex file). 

I will also include the pdf of the lecture given by Dr. Hemminger. 

## Discussion_Material:
This directory contains the problems and solutions covered during the discussion sections of the course. 
Webassign homework/solutions will not be made available, please continuously check your webassign and email to make sure you complete all of the assignments as they are generated. 

Each week an assignment containing three problems will be generated for students to work on.
These questions will be more representative of what an exam question will look like (and may be used as inspiration for exam questions). 
Each assignment will contain one question that will require mathematical software to solve. 
Solutions to these questions (source code) will also be provided here in terms of a mathematica notebook, and a Python script. 
Students are encouraged to choose either language, download the solutions, and compile them on their local machine. 

The exam will be a traditional in-class exam, therefore, no programming/computational methods will be tested on the exam. 

### Resources:
Feel free to look at the other materials on my github as potential resources. 
Chem131C contains materials for a thermodynamis course taught at UCI, however, it covers topics in Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics as well as Thermodynamics. 

I also have various programming examples for learning Python.
