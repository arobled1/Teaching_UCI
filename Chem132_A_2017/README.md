# Welcome:
You have found my notes for Thermodynamics, Chem132A at UCI (Fall 2017). 

Topics included are: 

## Instructors:
The instructor for the course is `Dr. ` ()

Teaching Assistants :
`` (), and `Shane Flynn` (swflynn@uci.edu).

## Logistics:

#### Lecture:

#### Textbook:
The suggested text for the class is 

#### Grading:
The grading is subject to change, however, expect something like 

## Lecture_notes:
Directory containing all of my typed Lecture Notes for the course. 
Each lecture is written in a LaTex file (name.tex) and converted to a pdf. 
If you are familiar with LaTex, feel free to download the Tex file and edit as you like (I have included all of the figures and etc. for compiling the Tex file). 

## Sample_Problems:
This directory contains a few sample programs as an introduction to programming. 
Programs will be written in Mathematica (Chem 5 software), and Python (a great first programming language). 


Feel free to lookat the other materials on my github as potnetial resources. 
Chem131C contains materials for a thermodynamis course taught at UCI.
This course will have some similar material, however, it was taugh after Quantum Mechanics and contains materials on statistical and quantum statistical mehcanics as well as thermodynamics. 

I also have various programming examples for Python that can be used to learn basic scripting
