#### Textbook:
The suggested text for the class is `Physical Chemistry Thermodynamics, Structure, and Change (10 Edition)` by Peter Atkins and Julio de Paula. 

#### Grading:
The grading is subject to change, however, expect something like 


## Lecture_notes:
Directory containing all of my typed Lecture Notes for the course. 
Each lecture is written in a LaTex file (name.tex) and converted to a pdf. 
If you are familiar with LaTex, feel free to download the Tex file and edit as you like (I have included all of the figures and etc. for compiling the Tex file). 

## Sample_Problems:
This directory contains a few sample programs as an introduction to programming. 
Programs will be written in Mathematica (Chem 5 software), and Python (a great first programming language). 


Feel free to look at the other materials on my github as potential resources. 
Chem131C contains materials for a thermodynamis course taught at UCI, however, it contains materials involving Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics as well as Thermodynamics. 

I also have various programming examples for learning Python.
