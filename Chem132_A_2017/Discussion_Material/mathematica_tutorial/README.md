# The Notebook:
Alan Robledo (Furche Group UCI) developed an extremly useful tutorial for using mathematica.
This notebook covers everything from formatting and writing in the notebook, to basic mathematics, to plotting, and doing numerical integration. 
This notebook was made with Cehm132A in mind, and should be your first resource for learning the basics of mathematica!

The Mathematica software uses a file type called a notebook (nb). 
If you open the file `mathematica_tutorial.nb` on Github, it will be ~5000 lines. 
It is very long because it contains all the formatting and etc. associated with the notebook itself. 
Do not try to read through these ~5000 lines, it will not be useful.

## To Use:
1. Once you have mathematica installed on your computer you can open this file type. 

2. Open the mathematica_tutorial.nb file on github and copy the ~5000 lines of text.

3. Paste this text into a file on your computer `name.nb`, the file must have the `.nb` extension. 

4. Once you do this, open the file with mathematica and you will be able to work through the tutorial!
