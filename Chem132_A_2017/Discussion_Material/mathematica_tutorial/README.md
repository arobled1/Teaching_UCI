# The Notebook:
Mathematica uses a file type called a notebook (nb). 

If you open the file `mathematica_tutorial.nb` it will be ~5000 lines. 
It is very long becaause it contains all the formatting and etc associated with the notebook. 
Do not try to read through these ~5000 lines, it will not be useful.

## To Use:
Once you have mathematica installed on your computer you can open this file type. 
Simple open the mathematica_tutorial.nb file on github and copy the ~5000 lines of text.
Paste this text into a file on your computer `name.nb` 
Once you do this, open the file with mathematica and you will be able to work through the tutorial!
