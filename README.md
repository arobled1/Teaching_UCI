# Teaching Resources
Greetings!

Welcome to my Github. 
Here I will be posting various resources I make during my time as a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine. 
The resources will include my Lecture Notes (i.e. the notes I take during a given lecture), and comments/reviews of topics I think students may find useful that may not be covered in lecture. 
You will also find some basic programming (mostly Pythn and Fortran) where I solve various problems taken from textbooks, lecture, and my creation. 

I strive to make these materials as accurate as possible, however, I cannot guarantee they will be perfect (or up-to-date). 
Please use the materials with that in mind, and feel free to contact me if there are any potential mistakes.

## Summary of Materials
Here I provide a brief overview of the contents within each directory. 

### Chem131_C_2017:
Lecture notes and problems for the undergraduate Thermodynaimcs Course taught at UCI. 

`Lecturer: Craig Martens` (cmartens@uci.edu)

Teaching Assistants: Krista Parry` (parryk@uci.edu) and `Shane Flynn` (swflynn@uci.edu)

The course covers an undergraduate level (junior and senior) introduction to Thermodynamics (chemistry department). 
The course assumes knowledge of basic quantum chemistry and multi-variable calculus, but is essentially self-contained. 
Topics included are: the laws of Thermodynamics, Thermodynamic Potentials and Fundamental Equations, Statistical Mechanics and it connections to Thermodynamics, and Quantum-Statistical Mechanics connecting partition functions to Quantum Chemistry and Thermodynamics. 

#### Material Usage:
Please feel free to use and reproduce any of the resources on this page, given you provide proper citation and reference to the material. 
All Lecture Notes have been made with permission of the Lecturer, and are my adaptation of the topics covered. 
Any problems taken/adapted from textbooks will include reference to the book from which it came, I do not claim any rights to these materials.
