# Teaching Resources
Greetings!

Here I will make available various resources developed during my time as a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine. 
The resources will include my Lecture Notes (i.e. the notes I take during a given lecture), and comments/reviews of topics I think students may find useful to better understand the lecture material. 
You will also find some basic programming (mostly Python and Fortran) where I solve various problems taken from textbooks, lecture, and curiosity.  

I strive to make these materials as accurate as possible, however, I cannot guarantee they will be perfect (or up-to-date). 
Please use the materials with that in mind, and feel free to contact me if there are any potential mistakes I can correct. 

## Using Github:
If you are new to github, you can think of this as a dropbox, there are files that can be updated dynamically.
Each folder contains materials that you can look at online, and/or download to your local device.
Simply click the files on the left hand side (in blue) at the top of each page, do not use the middle section (gray). 

If you are familiar with Github, feel free to use the resources as you wish.
I am open to collaboration for developing new materials!

## Summary of Materials
Here I provide a brief overview of the contents within each directory. 

### Chem131_C_2017:
Lecture notes and problems for the undergraduate Thermodynamics Course taught at UCI. 

`Lecturer: Craig Martens` (cmartens@uci.edu)

Teaching Assistants: `Krista Parry` (parryk@uci.edu) and `Shane Flynn` (swflynn@uci.edu)

This course covers an undergraduate level (junior and senior) introduction to Thermodynamics (Chemistry Department). 
The course assumes knowledge of basic quantum chemistry and multi-variable calculus, but is essentially self-contained. 

Topics included are: the Laws of Thermodynamics, Thermodynamic Potentials and Fundamental Equations, Statistical Mechanics and it connections to Thermodynamics, and Quantum-Statistical Mechanics connecting partition functions to Quantum Chemistry and Thermodynamics. 
To keep the mathematics simple, we only consider the ideal gas law as our system model (van der Walls and virial equations are not covered). 

### Chem132_A_2017:
Lecture notes and problems for the undergraduate Thermodynamics Course taught at UCI. 

`Lecturer:

Teaching Assistants: 

This course covers an undergraduate level (junior and senior) introduction to Thermodynamics (Chemistry Department). 
The course provides a standard introduction to thermodynamics without any knowledge of quantum mechanics. 

Topics included are: 


## Material Usage:
Please feel free to use and reproduce any of the resources on this page, given you provide proper reference and/or citation to the material. 
All Lecture Notes have been made with permission of the Lecturer, and are my adaptation of the topics covered. 
Any problems taken/adapted from textbooks will include reference to the book from which it came, I do not claim any rights to these materials (the solutions/programs are my understadning of the topic).
